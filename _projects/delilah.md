Delilah is a computational storage engine that leverages eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) to provide efficient data storage and retrieval. It is designed to bring processing power closer to where data is stored, reducing latency and improving overall system performance. The use of eBPF technology provides a standard interface for accessing and processing data, making it easier for software developers to write applications that take advantage of the benefits of computational storage. Delilah provides a secure way to access and process sensitive data, making it possible to store sensitive data on computational storage devices and process it in a secure and controlled manner. With its innovative technology, Delilah has the potential to transform the way we manage and process data, opening up new possibilities for data processing and management.
