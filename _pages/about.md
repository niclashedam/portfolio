Hey there! I'm Niclas and I'm currently a PhD Fellow at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk) in the [Data-intensive Systems and Applications](https://dasya.itu.dk) group. I'm all about exploring the intersection of security and data systems, and my goal is to figure out how to guarantee the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of modern data systems and computational storage.

I've been working in the field for a bit, starting with my Bachelor's degree in Software Development in 2019 and then moving on to specialize in information security during my Master's degree in Computer Science in 2022. Before starting my PhD, I was a Research Assistant at ITU, where I got to work with some amazing researchers and gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities in the field.

Right now, I'm working on a project called [Delilah](/projects/delilah/), which is all about experimenting with eBPF-based offload on computational storage in large-scale data pipelines. The goal is to make data pipelines more efficient and scalable while still keeping them secure. I'm proud to say that I was the one who created the first publicly described computational storage device that runs eBPF.

I'm really interested in cross-disciplinary research, and my key areas of focus include data systems, security, privacy, and computational storage. Thanks for stopping by!
