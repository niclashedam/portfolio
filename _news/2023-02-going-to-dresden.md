I am happy to announce that I will be going on a stay abroad to TU Dresden's Database Group, where I will be embarking on a journey to explore my research focus on computational storage. This opportunity provides me with the chance to interact with experts in the field and learn from their experiences, which will significantly contribute to my research endeavors and academic growth.

As a PhD fellow, I am always seeking ways to expand my knowledge and skills, and this stay abroad to TU Dresden's Database Group is the perfect avenue to do so. Along with gaining valuable knowledge, I will have the chance to work on collaborative projects, both within the group and across the DAPHNE consortium, which includes ITU.

The Database Group's research activities align precisely with my interests in enhancing the classical concept of a database management system by adding application-specific functionalities. Therefore, this stay abroad to TU Dresden will provide me with an opportunity to engage in research that aligns with my interests, furthering my knowledge and skills in computational storage.

I am particularly excited about the Database Group's involvement in the DAPHNE consortium with ITU, as it indicates that TU Dresden's research goals are well-aligned with my research interests and objectives. This involvement presents an even greater incentive for me to pursue this stay abroad as it increases the likelihood of yielding productive and fruitful outcomes.

I look forward to sharing my experiences with you as I embark on this exciting journey to TU Dresden's Database Group, where I will be working with like-minded experts and engaging in research that aligns with my interests. Stay tuned for more updates!
