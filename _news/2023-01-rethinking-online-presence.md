I am thrilled to announce the launch of my new website, which aims to provide a reliable source of information about me and my work. In today's digital age, it is more important than ever to have accurate and trustworthy information easily accessible. The website will not only showcase my publications, CV and contact information, but also any ongoing projects like Delilah and any lessons learnt while working on them.

One of the key focuses of my website is to combat misinformation, a growing concern in today's society. I believe that we have a moral and social obligation to ensure that the information we disseminate is accurate and truthful. As the Roman legal principle states, "Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus" - meaning "False in one thing, false in everything". This quote highlights the importance of accuracy and truthfulness in all aspects of life, particularly in the context of information and the dangers of misinformation.

I hope that my website will provide a valuable resource for anyone interested in my work and the issues that I am passionate about. I invite you to visit the site and explore the various sections, including my bio, portfolio, and contact information. Whether you are a current or potential collaborator, or just curious, the site has something for everyone. Thank you for your interest in me and my work!
